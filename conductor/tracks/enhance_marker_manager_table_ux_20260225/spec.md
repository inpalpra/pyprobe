# Track Specification: Enhance the marker manager table UX.

## Overview
This track aims to improve the User Experience (UX) of the Marker Manager table in the PyProbe Plots application. The Marker Manager is essential for interacting with specific points on DSP waveforms and constellations. The current UX needs refinement to make adding, editing, and deleting markers more intuitive and visually clear.

## Goals
- Redesign the Marker Manager table layout for better readability and accessibility.
- Implement robust row interactions (e.g., inline editing, clear selection states).
- Ensure synchronization between the table view and the plotted data remains seamless.

## Requirements
- The table must be built using PyQt6.
- All changes must adhere to the high-performance constraints required for real-time DSP visualization.
- The UX should align with the established themes (Cyberpunk, Monokai, Ocean).
