# Project Tracks

This file tracks all major tracks for the project. Each track has its own detailed plan in its respective folder.

- [x] **Track: if i create a bunch of markers on a waveform graph, then switch view to FFT mag and phase, and then switch back to waveform view, i lose all my markers and must set them up again. i don't want to lose my markers just because i switched views/lenses**

- [ ] **Track: when dragging markers in waveform graph or fft mag/phase lens of waveform, markers stick to the trace smoothly. the same is not true for complex waveforms.**
