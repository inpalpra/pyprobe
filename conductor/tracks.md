# Project Tracks

This file tracks all major tracks for the project. Each track has its own detailed plan in its respective folder.

- [x] **Track: if i create a bunch of markers on a waveform graph, then switch view to FFT mag and phase, and then switch back to waveform view, i lose all my markers and must set them up again. i don't want to lose my markers just because i switched views/lenses**

- [x] **Track: similar to how keysight PXA or keysight VNA have equation editor, i want pyprobe to have an equation editor as well.**

- [ ] **Track: fix the decimation or zoom related ux bug where some traces don't show their last part on graphs unless user zooms in to that area of the graph. graphs rendered this way are useless @../../.gemini/tmp/pyprobe/images/clipboard-1772347106142.png**
