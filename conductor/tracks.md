- [x] **Track: if i create a bunch of markers on a waveform graph, then switch view to FFT mag and phase, and then switch back to waveform view, i lose all my markers and must set them up again. i don't want to lose my markers just because i switched views/lenses**

- [x] **Track: similar to how keysight PXA or keysight VNA have equation editor, i want pyprobe to have an equation editor as well.**
