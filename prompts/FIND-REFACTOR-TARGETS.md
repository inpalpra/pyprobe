There are many .py files in this project. Pick files that are in most dire need of refactoring to make it easier for AI agents to understand, add features or fix bugs.

Create an analysis document on why you picked those files and what benefits will we get from refactoring them?

Create or overwrite `./plans/refactor/refactoring_analysis.md` with your analysis.
